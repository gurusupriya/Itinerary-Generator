The French Gothic Cathedral covers 45,000 square feet, an area equal to that of London’s Westminster Abbey, and is longer and taller than St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York City. Built over a 55-year period, beginning at the turn of the century, the land was purchased in 1871 for $60,000. The cost, initially estimated at $1 million, soon rose to $18 million. Most of the money was raised through large donations and church collections throughout the Archdiocese. The edifice was dedicated on October 19, 1954. The title of ""Sacred Heart"" honors Jesus Christ's love for humanity. He made the human face of God's love present in Galilee. The same love reached out to us here and now. We invite you to allow the Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart to lead you in prayer and to deepen your own faith, hope, and love.  Suggest edits to improve what we show.

Excellent trails (easy to moderate) that we enjoyed with a dog on a Sunday and the trails weren’t crowded.  Highly Recommend the Needwood trail on the eastern side of the lake with its wonderful lakeside vistas and clearly marked trails.  On the western side, we recommend the aptly named Westside Trail - this is further from the waters edge but has wider trails with lots of interesting vegetation and occasional views of the lake from a higher elevation.  Not the biggest lake by far so you can go around the lake in 1-1.5 hrs. Although technically the trails do not loop around the entire lake on the northern tip, there is a pedestrian sidewalk with barriers next to the road that is outside the park property that people walk across from the west to the east side of the lake, and vice versa.

Hangar # 1 was listed onto the National Register of Historic Places in September of 1997. Naval Air station (NAS) Wildwood was commissioned on April 1, 1943. The site served as an active dive-bomber squadron training facility from 1943 to 1945. Aircraft stationed at NAS Wildwood included TBM Avengers, Douglas Dauntlesses, Vought Corsairs and Curtiss Helldivers. Forty-two airmen perished while training at NAS Wildwood during World War II. In June 1997, NASW Foundation purchased Hangar #1 at the Cape May Airport. The 92,000 square-foot all-wooden structure was in a state of disrepair and required extensive renovation. Under the stewardship of NASW Foundation, the hangar was listed on the New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places at the National Significance Level. NAS Wildwood Aviation Museum now boasts over 26 aircraft displays as well as exhibits of military memorabilia, engines, photographs and more. Additionally, the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia has provided NAS Wildwood with a wealth of interactive exhibits that allow visitors to discover the science of flight.

Although this year was expected to have a super bloom, the Lake Ave exit on 15 was closure and the road block to Walker Canyon presented very unpleasant experience for us. Don’t understand why the city is doing that since this is a public hill and the wild flowers are there the enjoyment of the public not for the few from the local government. 

However, I was still able to see patches of poppies by driving a road parallel to the freeway and going up the hill next to Walker Canyon. The California poppies were blooming in patches everywhere, but I would recommend waiting for another month and some more rain for a full bloom experience. 

Despite the inconvenience, I still enjoy coming to Walker Canyon to see the wails flowers. By regis k  5 of 5 bubbles Mar 2022 Walker Canyon Trail minus the Supper Bloom With the advent of summer like weather in Southern California (temperatures ranging from 85 to 92 degrees) over the last several weeks, decided to venture out for a “Explore Southern California Expedition” and to do a bit of hiking. Loaded up the vehicle with essential items and filled the gas tank ($6.27 gallon) and headed south to Lake Elsinore, California. First stop on this adventure was at the Walker Canyon Trail located off the Interstate Highway 15 just north of Lake Elsinore. This 9.2 mile out and back trail was the site of the 2019 California Super Bloom, which drew in thousands of sightseers to the area. This trail is rated moderate and can be accomplished in 4 to 5 hours barring a “zillion” tourists. This trail is ideal for bird watching, sightseeing, and hiking and running. No fees or permits are required, and the trail is open year-round. Pets are welcome but must always remained on a leash. The trails are on dirt roads, and you will gain 1,761 feet in altitude while completing this hike. During my 5 hours plus hike of this trail, observed several hikers on the trail. Vastly different from the 2019 Super Bloom escapade. Due to the severe drought in Southern California, there are very few flowers to observe. One will see dried out tumbleweeds, chaparral, and brown hillsides. Wildlife is present and noted a few coyotes and numerous rabbits on the hillsides. Birds are plentiful, especially ravens and falcons. Interesting trail that will give you a good workout. Remember this is Southern California, and the local conditions are hot and extremely dry. Bring lots of water and wear appropriate clothing. If you into hiking, this is a good opportunity for a workout.

I always go for a run and my husband and I always bring our puppy to the dog park. However today I had to leave from the dog park because someone had a big size dog in the little dog area. I had just arrived and the dog literally flipped my puppy and every time my doggy would run with other small dogs . This dog would chase it and bite at his tail to the point of cornering him. My puppy started getting scared and I had to leave. It had not even been 3 min. The owner would just call for his dog but thought it was funny. I just want to know if it can be implemented for owners to make sure they have their big dogs in the big dog area. I was not with my husband and didn’t know what else to do but to leave . I did not want to wait for my dog to get hurt or for that dog to bite him. By quetzali m  5 of 5 bubbles Nov 2020 Nice Park with a Trail and Other Amenities We spent about two hours at the park.  There is a trail about three miles long and while parts of it can be steep, most of it is shaded, which is nice in the summer.  The park itself has a playground that is farm-themed.  There is also two dogs parks; they are located next to each other, but one is for small dogs and the other is for big dogs.  

On the day that we were there, there was a film crew there and we got to see how they use the farmhouse and older buildings as a backdrop for their historical film.

If you are meeting someone at the park, be sure to note that there are two separate entrances.  There is plenty of paved parking.  Restrooms were surprisingly clean.

It was here in Carneros that we planted new roots, building upon a 460-year winemaking legacy to create the next generation of estate-grown, artisan wines. We named it Artesa. 150 acres. Over 50 blocks. Sustainably Farmed. Our Estate Vineyard is set in the steep foothills that straddle the Carneros and Mt. Veeder AVAs. An ideal mix of topography and a cool, coastal climate make our location among the most prized Chardonnay and Pinot Noir vineyards in California. The Artesa Estate Vineyard is Fish Friendly Farming and Napa Green Land certified. Artesa: Born in Barcelona. Raised in Napa Valley. We strive to bring the best of our native and adopted homes to you in each bottle of our wines. And we hope that it enhances those moments when we are a part of your life. ¡Salud!

Improve this listing About Over 25 years ago, Spain’s oldest winemaking family ventured to a new world: a sea-facing hillside in the Napa Valley, with rocky soils and a favorable coastal climate. It was here in Carneros that we planted new roots, building upon a 460-year winemaking legacy to create the next generation of estate-grown, artisan wines. We named it Artesa. 150 acres. Over 50 blocks. Sustainably Farmed. Our Estate Vineyard is set in the steep foothills that straddle the Carneros and Mt. Veeder AVAs. An ideal mix of topography and a cool, coastal climate make our location among the most prized Chardonnay and Pinot Noir vineyards in California. The Artesa Estate Vineyard is Fish Friendly Farming and Napa Green Land certified. Artesa: Born in Barcelona. Raised in Napa Valley. We strive to bring the best of our native and adopted homes to you in each bottle of our wines. And we hope that it enhances those moments when we are a part of your life. ¡Salud!

Crowley's Ridge, a geologic anomaly, is the most unusual of Arkansas's six major physiographic provinces, or natural divisions. It is covered with a lush, mixed hardwood forest including oak, hickory, and uncommon hardwood trees such as American Beech, Sugar Maple, Butternut, Basswood, Cucumbertree, Kentucky Coffeetree, and Tuliptree or Yellow Poplar. Village Creek State Park is one of five Arkansas state parks on Crowley's Ridge. At 6,911 acres, Village Creek is Arkansas's second largest state park in land area. Park interpretive programs and exhibits share the story of the natural and cultural heritage of Crowley's Ridge. Five park trails totaling seven miles allow hikers the opportunity to explore this forest on their own, or on a guided trail walk with a park interpreter. A multi-use trail system within the park offers both mountain biking and hiking. Anglers can fish for bass, bream, catfish, and crappie at the park's two lakes, Lake Austell and Lake Dunn. Launch ramps, boat docks, bait, fishing boats, electric motors, and pedal boats are available late-spring through Labor Day. Visitors can bring their own canoe or kayak for some scenic paddling. The park campground includes 96 campsites [24 Class AAA, five Class A, and 67 Class B sites (for RVs, tents, and horse campers)] around Lake Dunn. Nestled on a nearby ridge are the park's 10 fully-equipped cabins that feature kitchens and wood-burning fireplaces–ready for a comfortable weekend stay. At Lake Austell, picnic sites are near a sandy beach and sun deck. The park also includes four standard pavilions (one is enclosed), playgrounds, baseball and multi-use fields, and a driving range. Horseback riding is a popular activity at this park. Twenty-five miles of multi-use trails wind through the rolling hills of Crowley's Ridge. The horse trails are open throughout the year. Call the park for current trail conditions. The horse camp features 30 campsites with water and electric hookups, an asphalt parking pad, picnic table and grill; a modern bathhouse; horse wash bays; and 66 stalls inside the camping area.

Improve this listing About Explore the unique geology, topography, and unusual plant communities of Crowley's Ridge, a landform of rolling hills in eastern Arkansas's Mississippi Alluvial Plain. Crowley's Ridge, a geologic anomaly, is the most unusual of Arkansas's six major physiographic provinces, or natural divisions. It is covered with a lush, mixed hardwood forest including oak, hickory, and uncommon hardwood trees such as American Beech, Sugar Maple, Butternut, Basswood, Cucumbertree, Kentucky Coffeetree, and Tuliptree or Yellow Poplar. Village Creek State Park is one of five Arkansas state parks on Crowley's Ridge. At 6,911 acres, Village Creek is Arkansas's second largest state park in land area. Park interpretive programs and exhibits share the story of the natural and cultural heritage of Crowley's Ridge. Five park trails totaling seven miles allow hikers the opportunity to explore this forest on their own, or on a guided trail walk with a park interpreter. A multi-use trail system within the park offers both mountain biking and hiking. Anglers can fish for bass, bream, catfish, and crappie at the park's two lakes, Lake Austell and Lake Dunn. Launch ramps, boat docks, bait, fishing boats, electric motors, and pedal boats are available late-spring through Labor Day. Visitors can bring their own canoe or kayak for some scenic paddling. The park campground includes 96 campsites [24 Class AAA, five Class A, and 67 Class B sites (for RVs, tents, and horse campers)] around Lake Dunn. Nestled on a nearby ridge are the park's 10 fully-equipped cabins that feature kitchens and wood-burning fireplaces–ready for a comfortable weekend stay. At Lake Austell, picnic sites are near a sandy beach and sun deck. The park also includes four standard pavilions (one is enclosed), playgrounds, baseball and multi-use fields, and a driving range. Horseback riding is a popular activity at this park. Twenty-five miles of multi-use trails wind through the rolling hills of Crowley's Ridge. The horse trails are open throughout the year. Call the park for current trail conditions. The horse camp features 30 campsites with water and electric hookups, an asphalt parking pad, picnic table and grill; a modern bathhouse; horse wash bays; and 66 stalls inside the camping area. The horse stable's 10' x 10' stalls include water, electric, and ceiling fans. The park visitor center includes an A/V theater, store, gift shop, and bicycle rentals.

The views are great, if you can actually look at them.  If you are the driver, everyone else on the road and the occupants will appreciate you watching the road. You are traveling on a single lane road that has spots of 1.5 lanes.  The traffic goes both directions. Some sections are very steep, with very steep drop-offs, the road is rough, and it is barely maintained. Your passengers may not like the experience of driving on a ledge at 10k+ ft elevation. 
You are at the mercy of the other drivers and their desire to get through with their lack of attention to look what is going on up the road. The good thing is the attentive and courteous drivers outnumbered the others

 I race cars on road courses, so I enjoy thrills.
I enjoyed Colorado 550 (between Ouray and Silverton) more than the Alpine Loop. 

I have driven on other roads in Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana that are in the Alpine.  I was able to enjoy the drive and enjoy the scenery on those. I would recommend those over the Alpine loop all the time.  2 of 5 bubbles Sept 2022 A Big Let Down This Year We are in our 60s and 70s and took friends to the San Juan’s for their first time. We have ridden the Alpine Loop 2 times over the past few years so this was our 3rd time, our friends first. Due to the open hostility by the residents of Silverton toward side x sides and tourism in general, we stayed in Lake City and left our little T-Rex sxs at home to avoid hostile confrontations. We are just too old for that. We rented a Jeep and “aired down” the tires. Seeing the loop in a Jeep just wasn’t the same. Rough riding and poor vision. The Alpine Loop is absolutely breath taking, but with the stress added by the citizens of Silverton, it is no longer worth the time and expense.  The people of Lake City were wonderful and welcoming, so it is great if you aren’t going upon the Alpine Loop.

We walked out of the fort area, back to our car, and then drove back into the fort. Again, we could not find any sign of the visitor center, so we left the area to go to lunch.

At the turn-of-the-century, George C. Boldt, millionaire proprietor of the world-famous Waldorf Astoria Hotel in NYC, set out to build a full-sized Rhineland Castle in Alexandria Bay, on Heart Island. The grandiose structure was to be a display of his love for his wife, Louise. Beginning in 1900, Boldt's family shared four summers on Wellesley Island while 300 workers, stonemasons, carpenters and artists fashioned the six story, 120-room castle, complete with tunnels, a powerhouse, Italian gardens, a drawbridge and a dovecote. In 1904, tragedy struck. Boldt telegrammed the island and commanded the workers to immediately ""stop all construction."" Louise had died suddenly. A broken-hearted Boldt could not imagine his dream castle without his beloved. Three hundred workers laid down their tools. Boldt never returned, leaving behind the structure as a monument of his love.  5 of 5 bubbles Sept 2025 Wonderful attraction, reasonably priced.

Boasting 50,000 tropical plants, rare international blooms and romantic Southern species, the horticultural displays at Gaylord Opryland are among the most exquisite in the world. Meticulously selected and lovingly maintained by a staff of 20 full-time interior horticulturists, the landscaping is a colorful, year-round paradise tucked inside this amazing resort. Each of the gardens is housed under one of the hotel's soaring atriums, creating a series of breathtaking horticultural wonderlands. An elaborate climate-control system keeps the temperature at 68-72 degrees Fahrenheit year round. Relative humidity stays around 55 percent most of the time. There is also an air exchange system to ensure air in the atriums does not become stale. The system exchanges air four times in a 24-hour period. The Garden Conservatory features a collection of 10,000 tropical plants, representing more than 215 species. Towering palms and banana trees rise 60 feet above the atrium floor. In all, there are 37 different families of trees represented, including ficus, banana trees, palms and a sampling of miniature orange trees. In August 1982, months before opening, a staff of 10 began landscaping the Garden Conservatory, which was at that time one of the largest facilities of its kind in a single, glass-topped room in the world. Many of the taller plants were put in place before construction was completed, in advance of installing the thousands of flowers that add color and texture to the majestic space. It took staff 3 months to install the gardens of the Garden Conservatory Atrium. A precise drip-irrigation system was developed that allows many plants to be watered slowly over the course of several hours. The soil is a special mixture of pine, peat and cypress bark solelite developed specifically for the environment. For the Cascades Atrium, dozens of Florida nurseries were visited before staff selected more than 8200 tropical ornamental plants representing 449 species. Plant varieties range from an Alexandria palm tree towering more than 40 feet high to six-foot-tall ginger bushes and jasminum vines. Sunlight levels are higher in the Cascades than in the Garden Conservatory, providing a sustainable environment for different plant varieties. Beyond the Cascades is the Delta Atrium, an amazing indoor garden with a subtropical feeling. Even though it is an indoor environment, 370 trees and palms--between 20- and 40-feet tall--share space with thousands of smaller plants. To create the appearance of the outdoors, black olive trees and West Indian mahoganies were chosen for their resemblance to oaks. Unlike oaks, they do not shed their leaves. And in true Southern tradition, Spanish moss trails from their imposing branches. Design of the Delta's gardens began two years before the Delta's opening in June 1996. Most of the plants originated in Florida. It took 32 tractor trailers to transport them to their new home in the protected environment of the Delta Atrium. The Delta is a true garden of the South with 120 sabal palms, tall lady palms, camellias, banana trees and cycads. Primary hedging plants are ever-blooming gardenia and camellias pittosporum (both green and variegated). There are 1500 plants representing 30 varieties of camellias in the Delta. Two 40-foot-tall Magnolia grandiflora (Southern magnolias) accent the front of the Delta Mansion.

Yaquina Head Outstanding Natural Area extends out from the Oregon coast, one mile into the Pacific Ocean. Standing 93 feet tall at the westernmost point of the basalt headland, the lighthouse has been a bright beacon of the night, guiding ships and their supplies along the west coast since the light was first lit on August 20, 1873. The offshore islands are a year-round refuge for harbor seals and a spring-summer home for thousands of nesting seabirds. Gray whales can be spotted during their annual migrations to Mexico (late fall-early winter) and Alaska (late winter-early spring). During the summer months some gray whales take the opportunity to feed in the shallow waters around the headland. Cobble Beach is compiled of millions of round basalt rocks that produce an applause-like sound as the waves roll in. When the tide is low a vibrant ocean floor is revealed—pools of colorful animals including orange sea stars, purple sea urchins, and giant green anemones. Rangers are at hand to answer questions and point out all of the amazing plants and animals that call the tide pools home. Visit the Interpretive Center and discover 140 years of lighthouse history and thousands of years of natural and cultural history. Friends of Yaquina Lighthouses, a non-profit organization, offers site-related books, maps, and postcards in their interpretive store. Whether you want to see raging winter storms batter the Oregon coast, learn about the role lighthouses played in the westward expansion of the United States, or watch peregrine falcons at play, visit Yaquina Head Outstanding Natural Area and experience something wild.

It’s the ideal place to spend an afternoon shopping, pampering oneself, and then having a relaxing meal al fresco. It currently features 41 designer shops and spas and 6 restaurants and cafes with more coming soon! Sunset Plaza has had, as its many tenants, haberdashers, agents, decorators, salons, restaurants and nightclubs such as the legendary Trocadero. Several of the tenants are historically notable for the part they played in Hollywood and design history, such as photographer George Hurrell, and fashion designers Adrian and Don Loper, and Elizabeth Arden. Most recently, Sunset Plaza was chosen as a location for Vanity Fair’s Oscar Party, where a large tent was built to highlight the gorgeous views over Los Angeles. A visit to Sunset Plaza is one of the consummate experiences of traversing the Sunset Strip. Taking a break from the hectic traffic and non-stop growth in the area is one of the most enjoyable ways to while away the afternoon.  5 of 5 bubbles Apr 2022 Celebrities incognito everywhere Undercover celebrities everywhere.

Gents show your ""package"" the girls are cougars By OCEAN GUY LOOKING FOR TRAVEL BUDDY  3 of 5 bubbles Jun 2021 Unique shopping Plaza After a good lunch, ventured over to the Sunset Plaza, to spend a few hours checking out the shops.  Reportedly Sunset Plaza is “one-of-a-kind” shopping area where you can complete all your shopping needs at one location.  This shopping center is unique, as it is not a conventional shopping center or mall.  Spread over two blocks of Sunset Boulevard, it seems to be a collection of retail stores with 660 parking spaces located in front and back side of the stores.  Parking is free.  The Plaza is currently home for 40 different business, (i.e., Restaurants (7), Health and Fitness Centers (6), Beauty Care (6), Miscellaneous Services (6), Fashion & Clothing stores (11) and Jewelry stores (5). Stopped off at the Sunset Kids boutique and purchased several items of clothing for our great granddaughter. Large selection of merchandise. Very friendly staff. Just be prepared for sticker shock. Clothing items are expensive. Most certainly not Walmart prices. It should be noted that the store directory is incorrect.  The Golden Hawk Clothing has shut down its Sunset Plaza location and moved to Beverly Hills. We were unable to locate several other businesses listed on the directory. Found numerous vacant shops located throughout the complex. As we wandered around noted a wide range of different eateries. Bossa Nova (Brazilian), Chin Chin (Asian and Chinese) and Tocaya Organica (Mexican).  All are top notch establishments with good ratings and reviews. Having just had lunch, we decided to pass on these restaurants.  Will return for lunch soon. Overall a nice mall with a lot to do and good selection of top-notch restaurants and shops. Great place to spend a few hours and to escape from the heat wave outside.

Improve this listing About Travellers’ Choice Best of the Best 2025 Haystack Rock is a unique 235 feet monolith that attracts wildlife and tourists alike and is part of the Oregon Coast’s geological history, formed millions of year ago by lava flows that created many of the dramatic capes and headlands along the coast. Haystack Rock is protected under U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as a seabird nesting colony and it is part of the Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge and is a State protected Marine Garden. The Rock is home to nesting seabirds in the summer and marine invertebrates all year. Tidepool seekers are beckoned by its wonders every day. The Haystack Rock Awareness Program (HRAP) is a stewardship and environmental educational program whose mission is to protect, through education, the intertidal and bird ecology of the Marine Garden and Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge at Haystack Rock. HRAP offers an extensive interpretive program on the beach during the spring and summer months around low tide.

Our mission is to create world-class, handcrafted wines that reflect our commitment to excellence and our love for this region. That commitment begins in our Estate Vineyard, which we re-planted in 2003 in order to capture the true character of Ballard Canyon, and which we meticulously farm in small lots. It extends to the winemaking process, during which we go to every possible length to achieve the delicate balance of ""elegance & power"" (Robert Parker, August 2010) for which our wines have become known around the world. Finally, it extends to our label, a Catalina tile, a family legacy symbol of our belief in the beauty of what arises from blending craft, earth, art and family.  Duration: 1-2 hours 1 of 5 bubbles Apr 2023 Stay away! Horrible wine, unfriendly staff, pompous. Beautiful scenery. Find a different winery nearby. Other wineries nearby far exceed this place. By dkbexpat  5 of 5 bubbles Apr 2023 The Real Deal Says: A Quality Setup. Go here if available. This is one of the only wineries I've been to that requires reservations. Given I've owned a winery that's saying a lot. Nonetheless once you get past that system and the technology is not that great, you're in for a treat that is the way the valley used to be before the movie sideways. The qualities of Rusack wine has always been excellent whether it's under the current winemaker or under John and Helen in the past. What made this tasting so impressive was they absolutely gear the tastings towards people and what they want. As an example if you're a wine club member they will have your wines ready for you based on your membership, or they may have a preference that you keep in their system and have that ready. They're just so many little touches that are unique. As an example when you come in you're greeted similar to a restaurant by someone at the front. They're checking not only your reservation and if you don't have one you're going to get turned away, but also pouring you a glass of Sauvignon Blanc just as you walk towards your table or seats. Once you're seated you will receive your pre-ordered cheeses or charcuterie plates and choose from three or four of the tastings. If you're a wine member they're even more benefits. The views are astonishing beautiful chairs overlooking the grapes sitting under three oak trees on a deck that's been built around those trees. The people who do the tastings are knowledgeable and can educate you and this is always a joy. I can't stress enough how unique this opportunity is. It is also limited because you're required to have reservations. But it's so worth making the trip and the plan.

That commitment begins in our Estate Vineyard, which we re-planted in 2003 in order to capture the true character of Ballard Canyon, and which we meticulously farm in small lots. It extends to the winemaking process, during which we go to every possible length to achieve the delicate balance of ""elegance & power"" (Robert Parker, August 2010) for which our wines have become known around the world. Finally, it extends to our label, a Catalina tile, a family legacy symbol of our belief in the beauty of what arises from blending craft, earth, art and family.  Duration: 1-2 hours 1 of 5 bubbles Apr 2023 Stay away! Horrible wine, unfriendly staff, pompous. Beautiful scenery. Find a different winery nearby. Other wineries nearby far exceed this place. By dkbexpat  5 of 5 bubbles Apr 2023 The Real Deal Says: A Quality Setup. Go here if available. This is one of the only wineries I've been to that requires reservations. Given I've owned a winery that's saying a lot. Nonetheless once you get past that system and the technology is not that great, you're in for a treat that is the way the valley used to be before the movie sideways. The qualities of Rusack wine has always been excellent whether it's under the current winemaker or under John and Helen in the past. What made this tasting so impressive was they absolutely gear the tastings towards people and what they want. As an example if you're a wine club member they will have your wines ready for you based on your membership, or they may have a preference that you keep in their system and have that ready. They're just so many little touches that are unique. As an example when you come in you're greeted similar to a restaurant by someone at the front. They're checking not only your reservation and if you don't have one you're going to get turned away, but also pouring you a glass of Sauvignon Blanc just as you walk towards your table or seats. Once you're seated you will receive your pre-ordered cheeses or charcuterie plates and choose from three or four of the tastings. If you're a wine member they're even more benefits. The views are astonishing beautiful chairs overlooking the grapes sitting under three oak trees on a deck that's been built around those trees. The people who do the tastings are knowledgeable and can educate you and this is always a joy. I can't stress enough how unique this opportunity is. It is also limited because you're required to have reservations. But it's so worth making the trip and the plan.

To get there, you'll need to take a 15-minute hike across slippery lava rocks, so wear a good pair of shoes. In summer, the pool resembles a large hot tub and the waters are calm and clear. During winter, however, the water can be treacherous, so avoid visiting during those months; the pool may even be closed. Before you go, be sure to check the surf report online, and only attempt the hike down if the waves are less than four feet high. – Tripadvisor  5 of 5 bubbles Jul 2024 Adventurous beauty for those physically fit.

Indiana's largest park is a traditional fall color hot spot, with nearly 20 miles of tree-lined roads and many scenic vistas overlooking miles of uninterrupted forestland.

Today McLeod Plantation is an important 37-acre Gullah/Geechee heritage site that has been carefully preserved in recognition of its cultural and historical significance. The grounds include a riverside outdoor pavilion, a sweeping oak allée, and the McLeod Oak, which is thought to be more than 600 years old. It is a place like no other, not frozen in time but vibrant, dynamic, and constantly evolving, where the winds of change whisper through the oak trees and voices from the past speak to all who pause to listen. McLeod Plantation was built on the riches of sea island cotton - and on the backs of enslaved people whose work and culture are embedded in the Lowcountry's very foundation. It is a living tribute to the men and women and their descendants that persevered in their efforts to achieve freedom, equality, and justice. All of their stories - black and white, enslaved and free - are given their due. After years of careful research and restoration, McLeod Plantation Historic Site invites visitors to embark upon an in-depth exploration of the lives of those people whose stories are essential to understanding Charleston's complex past and helped shape who we, as a nation, are today.

My husband and I started from Cumberland and stayed at local B&B's down through to DC and then took the train back to Cumberland. The trail has a variety of surfaces but overall manageable and entirely enjoyable. We had a day of rain but were prepared with pannier covers and our raincoats. We had a couple of detours along the way as there was maintenance going on. A storm had rolled through and we had a few trees down that we had to get our gear across. Trail was two-track from Cumberland through to Hancock - quite beautiful. We saw three river otters at Everetts Creek, lots of deer, herons, turtles, egrets etc. We traveled during the paw paw fruit harvest and enjoyed eating a few along the way. From Hancock on it was a gravelly type surface - not sure what it was but it was a ground stone that hardened and that surface was the easiest to travel. At Great Falls National Park, the surface got more gravelly with some larger rocks but was still manageable. The falls are spectacular and riding through the park you have great views of the Potomac and can see why the towpath was necessary. We were able to find the 0 marker and then biked around the DC National Mall. We took 6 days to bike - definitely quiet time to get away and enjoy the outdoors. We stayed at local B&B's along the way and Swains Lock - Lockhouse 21 on the trail. You have to bring your own linens and food in but we were prepared for that. Our overnights were in Paw Paw, Hancock, Williamsport, Harpers Ferry, Swains Lockhouse and then back to Cumberland. All in all, highly recommend if you are looking for a great biking adventure. By Jennifer B  5 of 5 bubbles Mar 2021 Great place for a short or long bicycle ride of walk. Great for walking or riding you bicycle. It is well maintained.

The guidance on the Park Service helped, as it told me which bus to use. Some buses stop in the Park and some go near to the park. I couldn't tell the difference, but kept an eye on where we were and got off and had a short walk to enter the park.

I was there on a week day, so not many people around. I explored the gun emplacements.

I used tick spray - don't know if this is an issue or not.

For generations of immigrants, the Statue of Liberty was the first glimpse of America—and what an entrance it made. Of course, the statue is an immigrant itself, originally coming from France as a diplomatic gift to celebrate the centennial of the Declaration of Independence. Since then, it’s become a symbol of hope, freedom, and the city itself. It’s also starred in countless movies, from The Brutalist to Ghostbusters II, and is plastered on practically everything imaginable in NYC’s souvenir shops.

Needless  to say my friend didn't  buy it either cause she didn't  know what it taste like. The second time we came in the same young lady I didn't  get her name she had glasses on and  tattoos on her hand and arms. We went up near the wine tasting  area the young girl  yelled out what are you needing.  We said we were going to buy some wine she said you can get it towards  the front area like she didn't  want us back there. Then when I said I was in the wine club she gave me one heck of a look even my friend noticed it both times we were in there. I use to love going there but the one young lady is going to run customers  away. I have to say I always bragged on the other ladies that have been there a long time. They are excellent.

I never complain when I go somewhere on the worker's but the one young lady with the glasses and tattoos on her hand and arm acts like no one should bother  her.

Love grabbing food from Auntie Yum Yum's, walking down to the dock, seeing the fisherman clean their catch from the day, and the boats sail in and out! Just breathtaking and can't wait to go back! Miss it!!!! By TCB  5 of 5 bubbles Jul 2022 Discovery Voyages - Can’t miss We did a 6 day live aboard on Discovery Voyages. Meg, Dean and crew were amazing. If you are looking for a one of a kind experience this it it. Hiking, Kayaking, Glaciers, Wildlife and you can even do a polar plunge from the boat!! Lol.

At the time of my visit, this lawn was being turned into a skating rink, and some restaurants already started to decorate their outdoor seating areas for winter holidays.

The outdoor area of the Park is well marked, has many info boards, giving the schedules of current and upcoming cultural and social events. When I was walking around the area in the late afternoon, it wasn't busy: some restaurants were open, and many entertainment venues were waiting for visitors in later hours.

Set on more than 1,200 acres in the heart of the Kentucky's famous Bluegrass region, the park is THE place to get close to horses! Featuring dozens of breeds of horse at work and at play, the park showcases the horse in daily equine presentations, horse drawn tours, horseback and pony rides, and an array of horse shows and special events throughout the year. The park's International Museum of the Horse, a Smithsonian Affiliate, is the world's largest equestrian museum. Offering both the experienced horseman and novice an opportunity to explore the many facets of humanity's relationship with the horse, the museum is dedicated to all breeds and disciplines of horse and covers some 50-million years of equine history. State-of-the-art technology complements rare artifacts and scholarly research to present a unique, educational, museum experience for all ages. The American Saddlebred Museum, the Showplace for Saddlebreds, celebrates Kentucky's first native breed of horse. The museum features interactive exhibits and a movie. With the park's own tourist activities and the numerous additional horse shows that take place in the equine competition facilities throughout the year, there can be a fair amount of walking involved, depending on visitor interest level.

Peak of Otter shouldn't be a designation.  Just enjoy a little of the Blue Ridge Pkwy and then get off. The Lodge is also over priced for what they offer. By smcdaniel  5 of 5 bubbles Aug 2021 This is not to be missed - absolutely breathtaking Just before you get to the Peaks of Otter Lodge on the left. Small gift shop, restrooms and info on hiking. Several trail heads start behind the center.

We hiked the harkening hill loop trail 3.3 miles, it’s a lot of uphill walking followed by a lot of downhill. I wouldn’t call it an easy hike.

We also did the Abbot Lake Trail (1 mile), the trail is paved the entire way. Only took us 15 mins to walk the entire thing. Very easy walk, wouldn’t call it a hike more like a stroll. 

Sharp Top Store is directly across the road on your right. Purchase shuttle tickets inside the shop. Start of the hiking trail is there also.

Shuttle goes up to the top of sharp top on the hour. Last shuttle is at 4pm. Once at the shuttle stop at the top, there’s a 15 minute walk up many flights of stairs to get to the top. There’s a shaded structure just before the peak for shade. The shuttle stop at the top has a shaded alcove with benches so you can wait for the return shuttle. 
The day we went, an elderly woman who was a nurse and recently replaced a hip decided to try and hike the entire way up (not smart). She fell and had to have the ranger service carry her down the mountain. We almost didn’t get to go up because the road only allows one car up and there’s no room to pass. They allowed us to be shuttled up. Then we had to wait for the return shuttle.

Bull's Sluice is an easy walk from the parking lot but can be risky for small children because of the pace of the water, it's fast. Woodall Shoals is a little flatter and water seem slower with plenty of calm spots for wading and swimming. Of the 2 spots I like Woodall Shoals for longer visits. Careful though as we came across a decent sized rattlesnake, one of my group almost stepped on it. Fortunately it must have been just chilling because it made no attempt to strike. The Shoals has plenty of flat rock areas for sitting and laying down for naps. By clemson_grad79  5 of 5 bubbles Jul 2017 Cool down with nature We had company visit and decided to go on an adventure to check this place out. Needless to say, we came back the very next day! 
The water is clean and cool. Be sure it's warm outside before you climb in...
You can choose the beach area or be an adventure and go to the right, climb a little ways down, and play in the water there. It's beautiful. 
We like to float from the right path down to the beach.

Renowned Kiowa-Comanche artist Blackbear Bosin donated the Keeper of the Plains to the citizens of Wichita on May 18, 1974.Since the sculpture's installation to commemorate the United States Bicentennial, it has become a symbol for the city of Wichita and a tribute to the local American Indian tribes. in 1974.

The 44-foot Cor-Ten steel Keeper of the Plains statue is now 30 feet higher than before with its new pedestal,surrounded by a plaza which describes the Plains Indian way of life. The Keeper also serves as the focal point of an eight-year, $20 million restoration and river beautification project completed in May 2007. Pedestrians can access the area via two bow-and-arrow-inspired cable-stay bridges which span the Little and Big Arkansas rivers.

It was a fun experience, and I and my family thoroughly enjoyed it. People were very nice and friendly. The food at the stadium was terrible. A lot of venues pride themselves on the food they serve, but the hotdog aka Denny Dog was a hotdog and bun wrapped in aluminum foil and crushed as much as possible. Same with the Conecuh dog. The burger aka Big Al Burger was a patty and buns with nacho cheese drizzled over it wrapped in aluminum foil and squeezed as much as possible. The meat didn't look like hamburger meat at all, maybe it was soy, who knows. My whole family ended up sick with diarrhea. Shameful. A vendor behind U3 on the top deck were selling alcoholic drinks and automatically charging every single customer a 20% tip for every purchase which is credit card fraud. I will be disputing it with my bank. If a vendor doesn't let you see the tip screen when purchasing, something shady is going on. The only other thing that pissed us off was the public parking. People were sitting at virtually every entrance to various campus facilities but would only let faculty, staff, etc. park there. Some of these parking lots were totally empty. Too convenient to let the public park there. Too much greed. Ridiculous that an Orthopedic Surgeon parking lot would charge people $40 to park in their lost for 4 hours. Greed greed greed.

I relocated from Brazil to Alaska in 2001 and have been chasing and photographing Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) ever since. I never heard about the Northern Lights before I moved to Alaska. The first time I saw them it was love at first sight. That was it! From there on I knew what I wanted to do, I wanted to share the Auroras with the world and show them to everyone who doesn't have the opportunity to see the Northern lights. That's what I have been doing since. From long and cold nights photographing amazing auroras through the skies, and teaching northern lights photography workshops, to the summers explaining and showing the auroras to the ones that are not able to visit Alaska in the winters. I am a photographer in Alaska, living the dream life of many photographers.

Judd’s formerly private living and working spaces provide firsthand experience of Judd’s concept of permanent installation in the Chihuahuan Desert. Judd Foundation offers two different guided visits of properties in downtown Marfa, La Mansana de Chinati/The Block and The Studios. Advance reservations for guided visits are required. La Mansana de Chinati / The Block Daily, 11:00am-12:30pm and Thursday-Sunday from 4:30pm-5:45pm. Doors open 10 minutes in advance of start time. Visits to The Block begin promptly at their scheduled time. Advance reservations are required. Guided visits start at the gated entrance to La Mansana de Chinati/The Block, across from Godbold feed mill, at 400 West El Paso Street, which is at the intersection of Kelly and El Paso streets, 3 blocks west of Judd Foundation offices. La Mansana de Chinati, Judd’s residence and studio in Marfa, informally known as The Block, is the site of some of the artist’s first large-scale architectural projects. Guided visits provide access to Judd’s three main studios, which are permanently installed with his early work, and his personal library, which houses his collection of over 13,000 books. Ticket Prices $25 per person, $12.50 students and seniors, with valid ID. Guided visits are free for full-time residents of Presidio, Brewster, and Jeff Davis counties. The Studios (Architecture Studio, Art Studio and the Cobb and Whyte Houses) Friday and Saturday, 1:30-3:15pm. Thursday, Friday and Saturday, 2:00-3:45pm. Visits to The Studios visits begin promptly at their scheduled time. Advance reservations are required. Guided visits start at the Judd Foundation offices, 104 South Highland Avenue, south of the railroad tracks, across the street from the Hotel St. George. The Studios visit provides access to a selection of Juddʼs downtown spaces, including the Architecture Studio, Art Studio, and the Cobb and Whyte Houses. These spaces contain furniture by Judd, as well as his early paintings from the 1950s and 60s, along with an extensive collection of modernist and period furniture, and works by other prominent twentieth century artists and designers. Ticket Prices $25 per person, $12.50 students and seniors, with valid ID. Guided visits are free for full-time residents of Presidio, Brewster, and Jeff Davis counties.  Duration: 1-2 hours 4 of 5 bubbles Dec 2023 Cool space but tours could be better I feel like minimalist art is love it or hate it. Don’t come here if you hate it. If you love it, the “Block” tour of Judd’s residence and the “studios” tour where he worked will be right up your alley. A few huge warehouses with classic Judd pieces and offices with furniture and paintings by Judd and other artists emphasizing simple forms and clean lines.

These spaces can only be viewed via tours with no photos allowed (think of it this way - you have to come to Marfa to see this stuff). The tours move at a glacial pace. 1.5 hours for the Blocks and 1 hour for the studios. Much of the tour involves standing around in non-climate-controlled spaces. It’s minimalist art! There’s not much to look at! The guides provide no real information about the art itself, which is the most interesting part and far from self-explanatory. Instead, we spent an eternity looking at Judd’s large library. It’s a room with books. It’s not that amazing. Basically, the tours should be half as long and provide twice as much information as they do. 

The Blocks tour should be prioritized. It has the most impressive installations and Judd pieces. The studios tour is mostly just office and work space.

An early leader in sustainability, Concannon helped pioneer the development of sustainable standards for winegrowing, and was one of the first wineries to receive sustainability certification. ​ Concannon continues the winemaking legacy, dedicated to crafting sustainable terroir-driven, Bordeaux-inspired wines. Today, an estimated 80% of California Cabernet Sauvignon have originated from the Concannon Clones.

Improve this listing About Pioneers of the California wine industry, Concannon Vineyard has a rich history dating back to the late 1800’s when James Concannon imported the “Mother Vine” from Bordeaux, France. ​ Trailblazing winemaking innovation, Concannon was responsible for introducing America's First Petite Sirah® and breaking gender barriers in the wine industry by hiring the first technically trained female winemaker in the 1950s. An early leader in sustainability, Concannon helped pioneer the development of sustainable standards for winegrowing, and was one of the first wineries to receive sustainability certification. ​ Concannon continues the winemaking legacy, dedicated to crafting sustainable terroir-driven, Bordeaux-inspired wines. Today, an estimated 80% of California Cabernet Sauvignon have originated from the Concannon Clones.

It is a very level walk along a beautiful creek, there are many fly fisherman casting along the water. We were there on a wonderful day, the weather was perfect so it made for a very relaxing time. By kirpatt2016  1 of 5 bubbles Aug 2020 R-E-S-P-E-C-T find out what it means to me The gorge is a picturesque spot and attracts many fly fishermen/women. Due to an influx in out of town visitors who have recently discovered this “hidden gem” the accessibility to the gorge has been closed and barricaded by local police for over a month. Sadly, this inaccessibility also extends to locals who reside along the gorge and access the gorge daily for recreational purposes such as fishing, biking, and running. 

This area is part of a larger expanse of preserved land in the area. The Ken Lockwood Gorge and neighboring Lake Solitude are not state parks. As such, there are no garbage receptacles here and no public restrooms. Please practice common courtesy and respect before you relieve yourself on the trail or in the yards of locals, block driveway access, and litter in yards. Picking fruit and flowers from personal gardens or wandering onto the property of others is also strongly discouraged. 

The waters of the gorge and Lake Solitude are not for swimming. Although it may be tempting on a hot day, the waters are primarily used for trout fishing. There are signs posted that denote this everywhere.

I highly recommend a visit to the gorge for individuals and families who enjoy biking, walking, and respecting nature. For those who intend to come to take a dip in the water, drink alcohol (and subsequently smash glass bottles on paths that bicyclists and dogs access), and litter I would highly recommend traveling elsewhere or perhaps, just stay at home.
