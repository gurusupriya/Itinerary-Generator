The French Gothic Cathedral covers 45,000 square feet, an area equal to that of London’s Westminster Abbey, and is longer and taller than St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York City. Built over a 55-year period, beginning at the turn of the century, the land was purchased in 1871 for $60,000. The cost, initially estimated at $1 million, soon rose to $18 million. Most of the money was raised through large donations and church collections throughout the Archdiocese. The edifice was dedicated on October 19, 1954. The title of ""Sacred Heart"" honors Jesus Christ's love for humanity. He made the human face of God's love present in Galilee. The same love reached out to us here and now. We invite you to allow the Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart to lead you in prayer and to deepen your own faith, hope, and love.  Suggest edits to improve what we show.

Excellent trails (easy to moderate) that we enjoyed with a dog on a Sunday and the trails weren’t crowded.  Highly Recommend the Needwood trail on the eastern side of the lake with its wonderful lakeside vistas and clearly marked trails.  On the western side, we recommend the aptly named Westside Trail - this is further from the waters edge but has wider trails with lots of interesting vegetation and occasional views of the lake from a higher elevation.  Not the biggest lake by far so you can go around the lake in 1-1.5 hrs. Although technically the trails do not loop around the entire lake on the northern tip, there is a pedestrian sidewalk with barriers next to the road that is outside the park property that people walk across from the west to the east side of the lake, and vice versa.

Hangar # 1 was listed onto the National Register of Historic Places in September of 1997. Naval Air station (NAS) Wildwood was commissioned on April 1, 1943. The site served as an active dive-bomber squadron training facility from 1943 to 1945. Aircraft stationed at NAS Wildwood included TBM Avengers, Douglas Dauntlesses, Vought Corsairs and Curtiss Helldivers. Forty-two airmen perished while training at NAS Wildwood during World War II. In June 1997, NASW Foundation purchased Hangar #1 at the Cape May Airport. The 92,000 square-foot all-wooden structure was in a state of disrepair and required extensive renovation. Under the stewardship of NASW Foundation, the hangar was listed on the New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places at the National Significance Level. NAS Wildwood Aviation Museum now boasts over 26 aircraft displays as well as exhibits of military memorabilia, engines, photographs and more. Additionally, the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia has provided NAS Wildwood with a wealth of interactive exhibits that allow visitors to discover the science of flight. The museum also features a library, food vending area as well as a recently expanded gift shop. In its role as a community resource, NAS Wildwood Aviation Museum regularly hosts activities including fly-ins, aviation festivals, big band concerts, swing dances, veterans’ ceremonies, historical lectures, school field trips and senior tours.

Although this year was expected to have a super bloom, the Lake Ave exit on 15 was closure and the road block to Walker Canyon presented very unpleasant experience for us. Don’t understand why the city is doing that since this is a public hill and the wild flowers are there the enjoyment of the public not for the few from the local government. 

However, I was still able to see patches of poppies by driving a road parallel to the freeway and going up the hill next to Walker Canyon. The California poppies were blooming in patches everywhere, but I would recommend waiting for another month and some more rain for a full bloom experience. 

Despite the inconvenience, I still enjoy coming to Walker Canyon to see the wails flowers. By regis k  5 of 5 bubbles Mar 2022 Walker Canyon Trail minus the Supper Bloom With the advent of summer like weather in Southern California (temperatures ranging from 85 to 92 degrees) over the last several weeks, decided to venture out for a “Explore Southern California Expedition” and to do a bit of hiking. Loaded up the vehicle with essential items and filled the gas tank ($6.27 gallon) and headed south to Lake Elsinore, California. First stop on this adventure was at the Walker Canyon Trail located off the Interstate Highway 15 just north of Lake Elsinore. This 9.2 mile out and back trail was the site of the 2019 California Super Bloom, which drew in thousands of sightseers to the area. This trail is rated moderate and can be accomplished in 4 to 5 hours barring a “zillion” tourists. This trail is ideal for bird watching, sightseeing, and hiking and running. No fees or permits are required, and the trail is open year-round. Pets are welcome but must always remained on a leash. The trails are on dirt roads, and you will gain 1,761 feet in altitude while completing this hike. During my 5 hours plus hike of this trail, observed several hikers on the trail. Vastly different from the 2019 Super Bloom escapade. Due to the severe drought in Southern California, there are very few flowers to observe. One will see dried out tumbleweeds, chaparral, and brown hillsides. Wildlife is present and noted a few coyotes and numerous rabbits on the hillsides. Birds are plentiful, especially ravens and falcons. Interesting trail that will give you a good workout. Remember this is Southern California, and the local conditions are hot and extremely dry. Bring lots of water and wear appropriate clothing. If you into hiking, this is a good opportunity for a workout. However, if you are only interested in seeing the poppies, recommend you stay home, as you will not find any this year By dnaleciz  Review snippets are selected by AI for relevance and recency and represent the opinions of Tripadvisor users, not Tripadvisor LLC.

In 1838, the Smith family and 30 of their slaves left two struggling plantations along the Georgia coast to make a new start with 300 acres of cotton farmland north of the Roswell Square. Their home, built by slave labor in 1845, was preserved by three generations of the Smith family and is now open to the public as a museum. Three generations of the Smith family lived in the home and saved many of their belongings. For over 160 years, Smith Plantation stood the test of time as all around it the small mill village of Roswell transformed into a bustling metropolitan suburb.

I always go for a run and my husband and I always bring our puppy to the dog park. However today I had to leave from the dog park because someone had a big size dog in the little dog area. I had just arrived and the dog literally flipped my puppy and every time my doggy would run with other small dogs . This dog would chase it and bite at his tail to the point of cornering him. My puppy started getting scared and I had to leave. It had not even been 3 min. The owner would just call for his dog but thought it was funny. I just want to know if it can be implemented for owners to make sure they have their big dogs in the big dog area. I was not with my husband and didn’t know what else to do but to leave . I did not want to wait for my dog to get hurt or for that dog to bite him. By quetzali m  5 of 5 bubbles Nov 2020 Nice Park with a Trail and Other Amenities We spent about two hours at the park.  There is a trail about three miles long and while parts of it can be steep, most of it is shaded, which is nice in the summer.  The park itself has a playground that is farm-themed.  There is also two dogs parks; they are located next to each other, but one is for small dogs and the other is for big dogs.  

On the day that we were there, there was a film crew there and we got to see how they use the farmhouse and older buildings as a backdrop for their historical film.

If you are meeting someone at the park, be sure to note that there are two separate entrances.  There is plenty of paved parking.  Restrooms were surprisingly clean.

Everyone working was very very nice and accommodating.  Reasonable $2 to get in per person and they had a ton of food trucks with lots of food variety.  Only thing we thought that was missing was antiques and more furniture items.  BUT that has nothing to do with Wolff's, just was happenstance.   Areas were clean. Overall was a great time!

By Giulia Larsen Bracco  5 of 5 bubbles Sept 2021 Great stadium and fun- especially on a warm breezy night. This is a beautiful clean stadium. The parking is easy and if you go to the summer St. Lucie Mets games, the parking is free. We go when they have specials like dollar night on Thursday nights. Everything is a dollar. Hotdogs, beer, soda and popcorn. The general admission tickets are awesome, we sit behind home plate. It’s a real hometown feeling.

During spring training the prices are higher but still the stadium is a fun place to visit. I didn’t go to the past two seasons but I am looking forward to going next season during spring training.

Duration: 1-2 hours 1 of 5 bubbles Feb 2024 Library Doesn't Care About Your 1st Amendment Rights Apparently, the staff does not care about the first Amendment of the United States Constitution. They claim their policy supersedes the first Amendment which is a federally protected constitutional right. If you have a phone out and record anything in a publicly accessible area of the public library, they will call the police on you. Even then after the library wasted the resources of the city by having the police show up, they refused to acknowledge that the public has the right to record video in a public library that is funded by the public.

The museum chronicles hundreds of years of history of Point Comfort and Fort Monroe where many decisions were made that impact the foundation and future of the United States. Housed inside the original casemates where several of the fort’s large guns remain in place, exhibits and dioramas explain the construction of the fort, what daily life was like through the ages and tell the stories of the many famous, and infamous, people who were here. The museum is open to the public Tues-Sun 10am-4pm and requires a timed-entry ticket that MUST be picked up at the Visitor & Education Center, 30 Ingalls Road, Fort Monroe, VA.  Duration: 1-2 hours 5 of 5 bubbles Oct 2023 Great Museum. Bring your camera and binoculars for some ship watching too. Worth a visit!  Why had I never heard of Fort Monroe and I'm a history buff! I arrived at 3:15 on a weekday, there was plenty of street parking, but I imagine parking is harder to find on a weekend because of the nearby park. Take the ranger tour and visit the Casemate Museum which is really well done.  I would bring a picnic lunch and plan on spending a good half day or more if the weather is good because you can walk around the top of the fort and also walk over to  the park and watch the ships. There's a fishing pier there, and a beach around the corner. I highly recommend a visit. By centralnyr  4 of 5 bubbles Jul 2023 Entered on the wrong side - that's on us! We made the mistake of parking across the street from the fort, and then crossing the moat by bridge during our walk on a hot July day. We had come through the East Gate. We walked to the right after we entered, and ended walking the entire way to the museum that we couldn’t enter as the tickets were supposedly gathered at the visitor center that we never found. We walked out of the fort area, back to our car, and then drove back into the fort. Again, we could not find any sign of the visitor center, so we left the area to go to lunch. I can’t recommend the fort as I am not sure what is there to see within it, and we didn’t get to see the visitor center or the museum. UPDATE: The visitor center is at 30 Ingalls Rd, Hampton, VA 23651, on the WEST side of the fort.

At the turn-of-the-century, George C. Boldt, millionaire proprietor of the world-famous Waldorf Astoria Hotel in NYC, set out to build a full-sized Rhineland Castle in Alexandria Bay, on Heart Island. The grandiose structure was to be a display of his love for his wife, Louise. Beginning in 1900, Boldt's family shared four summers on Wellesley Island while 300 workers, stonemasons, carpenters and artists fashioned the six story, 120-room castle, complete with tunnels, a powerhouse, Italian gardens, a drawbridge and a dovecote. In 1904, tragedy struck. Boldt telegrammed the island and commanded the workers to immediately ""stop all construction."" Louise had died suddenly. A broken-hearted Boldt could not imagine his dream castle without his beloved. Three hundred workers laid down their tools. Boldt never returned, leaving behind the structure as a monument of his love.  5 of 5 bubbles Sept 2025 Wonderful attraction, reasonably priced.

Boasting 50,000 tropical plants, rare international blooms and romantic Southern species, the horticultural displays at Gaylord Opryland are among the most exquisite in the world. Meticulously selected and lovingly maintained by a staff of 20 full-time interior horticulturists, the landscaping is a colorful, year-round paradise tucked inside this amazing resort. Each of the gardens is housed under one of the hotel's soaring atriums, creating a series of breathtaking horticultural wonderlands. An elaborate climate-control system keeps the temperature at 68-72 degrees Fahrenheit year round. Relative humidity stays around 55 percent most of the time. There is also an air exchange system to ensure air in the atriums does not become stale. The system exchanges air four times in a 24-hour period. The Garden Conservatory features a collection of 10,000 tropical plants, representing more than 215 species. Towering palms and banana trees rise 60 feet above the atrium floor. In all, there are 37 different families of trees represented, including ficus, banana trees, palms and a sampling of miniature orange trees. In August 1982, months before opening, a staff of 10 began landscaping the Garden Conservatory, which was at that time one of the largest facilities of its kind in a single, glass-topped room in the world. Many of the taller plants were put in place before construction was completed, in advance of installing the thousands of flowers that add color and texture to the majestic space. It took staff 3 months to install the gardens of the Garden Conservatory Atrium. A precise drip-irrigation system was developed that allows many plants to be watered slowly over the course of several hours. The soil is a special mixture of pine, peat and cypress bark solelite developed specifically for the environment. For the Cascades Atrium, dozens of Florida nurseries were visited before staff selected more than 8200 tropical ornamental plants representing 449 species. Plant varieties range from an Alexandria palm tree towering more than 40 feet high to six-foot-tall ginger bushes and jasminum vines. Sunlight levels are higher in the Cascades than in the Garden Conservatory, providing a sustainable environment for different plant varieties. Beyond the Cascades is the Delta Atrium, an amazing indoor garden with a subtropical feeling. Even though it is an indoor environment, 370 trees and palms--between 20- and 40-feet tall--share space with thousands of smaller plants. To create the appearance of the outdoors, black olive trees and West Indian mahoganies were chosen for their resemblance to oaks. Unlike oaks, they do not shed their leaves. And in true Southern tradition, Spanish moss trails from their imposing branches. Design of the Delta's gardens began two years before the Delta's opening in June 1996. Most of the plants originated in Florida. It took 32 tractor trailers to transport them to their new home in the protected environment of the Delta Atrium. The Delta is a true garden of the South with 120 sabal palms, tall lady palms, camellias, banana trees and cycads. Primary hedging plants are ever-blooming gardenia and camellias pittosporum (both green and variegated). There are 1500 plants representing 30 varieties of camellias in the Delta. Two 40-foot-tall Magnolia grandiflora (Southern magnolias) accent the front of the Delta Mansion.

Standing 93 feet tall at the westernmost point of the basalt headland, the lighthouse has been a bright beacon of the night, guiding ships and their supplies along the west coast since the light was first lit on August 20, 1873. The offshore islands are a year-round refuge for harbor seals and a spring-summer home for thousands of nesting seabirds. Gray whales can be spotted during their annual migrations to Mexico (late fall-early winter) and Alaska (late winter-early spring). During the summer months some gray whales take the opportunity to feed in the shallow waters around the headland. Cobble Beach is compiled of millions of round basalt rocks that produce an applause-like sound as the waves roll in. When the tide is low a vibrant ocean floor is revealed—pools of colorful animals including orange sea stars, purple sea urchins, and giant green anemones. Rangers are at hand to answer questions and point out all of the amazing plants and animals that call the tide pools home. Visit the Interpretive Center and discover 140 years of lighthouse history and thousands of years of natural and cultural history. Friends of Yaquina Lighthouses, a non-profit organization, offers site-related books, maps, and postcards in their interpretive store. Whether you want to see raging winter storms batter the Oregon coast, learn about the role lighthouses played in the westward expansion of the United States, or watch peregrine falcons at play, visit Yaquina Head Outstanding Natural Area and experience something wild.

It’s the ideal place to spend an afternoon shopping, pampering oneself, and then having a relaxing meal al fresco. It currently features 41 designer shops and spas and 6 restaurants and cafes with more coming soon! Sunset Plaza has had, as its many tenants, haberdashers, agents, decorators, salons, restaurants and nightclubs such as the legendary Trocadero. Several of the tenants are historically notable for the part they played in Hollywood and design history, such as photographer George Hurrell, and fashion designers Adrian and Don Loper, and Elizabeth Arden. Most recently, Sunset Plaza was chosen as a location for Vanity Fair’s Oscar Party, where a large tent was built to highlight the gorgeous views over Los Angeles. A visit to Sunset Plaza is one of the consummate experiences of traversing the Sunset Strip. Taking a break from the hectic traffic and non-stop growth in the area is one of the most enjoyable ways to while away the afternoon.  5 of 5 bubbles Apr 2022 Celebrities incognito everywhere Undercover celebrities everywhere.

Gents show your ""package"" the girls are cougars By OCEAN GUY LOOKING FOR TRAVEL BUDDY  3 of 5 bubbles Jun 2021 Unique shopping Plaza After a good lunch, ventured over to the Sunset Plaza, to spend a few hours checking out the shops.  Reportedly Sunset Plaza is “one-of-a-kind” shopping area where you can complete all your shopping needs at one location.  This shopping center is unique, as it is not a conventional shopping center or mall.  Spread over two blocks of Sunset Boulevard, it seems to be a collection of retail stores with 660 parking spaces located in front and back side of the stores.  Parking is free.  The Plaza is currently home for 40 different business, (i.e., Restaurants (7), Health and Fitness Centers (6), Beauty Care (6), Miscellaneous Services (6), Fashion & Clothing stores (11) and Jewelry stores (5). Stopped off at the Sunset Kids boutique and purchased several items of clothing for our great granddaughter. Large selection of merchandise. Very friendly staff. Just be prepared for sticker shock. Clothing items are expensive. Most certainly not Walmart prices. It should be noted that the store directory is incorrect.  The Golden Hawk Clothing has shut down its Sunset Plaza location and moved to Beverly Hills. We were unable to locate several other businesses listed on the directory. Found numerous vacant shops located throughout the complex. As we wandered around noted a wide range of different eateries. Bossa Nova (Brazilian), Chin Chin (Asian and Chinese) and Tocaya Organica (Mexican).  All are top notch establishments with good ratings and reviews. Having just had lunch, we decided to pass on these restaurants.  Will return for lunch soon. Overall a nice mall with a lot to do and good selection of top-notch restaurants and shops. Great place to spend a few hours and to escape from the heat wave outside.

Otherwise, visit during summer for the soft sand, arresting seaside views, and calmer waters—perfect for swimming, snorkeling, diving and even cliff-jumping. The wave conditions here fluctuate quickly, so look out for the colored flags before diving in.  5 of 5 bubbles Dec 2024 Amazing place to witness the sheer power of the ocean Very famous bay to witness huge waves and brave surfers trying to conquer them.

Our mission is to create world-class, handcrafted wines that reflect our commitment to excellence and our love for this region. That commitment begins in our Estate Vineyard, which we re-planted in 2003 in order to capture the true character of Ballard Canyon, and which we meticulously farm in small lots. It extends to the winemaking process, during which we go to every possible length to achieve the delicate balance of ""elegance & power"" (Robert Parker, August 2010) for which our wines have become known around the world. Finally, it extends to our label, a Catalina tile, a family legacy symbol of our belief in the beauty of what arises from blending craft, earth, art and family.  Duration: 1-2 hours 1 of 5 bubbles Apr 2023 Stay away! Horrible wine, unfriendly staff, pompous. Beautiful scenery. Find a different winery nearby. Other wineries nearby far exceed this place. By dkbexpat  5 of 5 bubbles Apr 2023 The Real Deal Says: A Quality Setup. Go here if available. This is one of the only wineries I've been to that requires reservations. Given I've owned a winery that's saying a lot. Nonetheless once you get past that system and the technology is not that great, you're in for a treat that is the way the valley used to be before the movie sideways. The qualities of Rusack wine has always been excellent whether it's under the current winemaker or under John and Helen in the past. What made this tasting so impressive was they absolutely gear the tastings towards people and what they want. As an example if you're a wine club member they will have your wines ready for you based on your membership, or they may have a preference that you keep in their system and have that ready. They're just so many little touches that are unique. As an example when you come in you're greeted similar to a restaurant by someone at the front. They're checking not only your reservation and if you don't have one you're going to get turned away, but also pouring you a glass of Sauvignon Blanc just as you walk towards your table or seats. Once you're seated you will receive your pre-ordered cheeses or charcuterie plates and choose from three or four of the tastings. If you're a wine member they're even more benefits. The views are astonishing beautiful chairs overlooking the grapes sitting under three oak trees on a deck that's been built around those trees. The people who do the tastings are knowledgeable and can educate you and this is always a joy. I can't stress enough how unique this opportunity is. It is also limited because you're required to have reservations. But it's so worth making the trip and the plan.

Today McLeod Plantation is an important 37-acre Gullah/Geechee heritage site that has been carefully preserved in recognition of its cultural and historical significance. The grounds include a riverside outdoor pavilion, a sweeping oak allée, and the McLeod Oak, which is thought to be more than 600 years old. It is a place like no other, not frozen in time but vibrant, dynamic, and constantly evolving, where the winds of change whisper through the oak trees and voices from the past speak to all who pause to listen. McLeod Plantation was built on the riches of sea island cotton - and on the backs of enslaved people whose work and culture are embedded in the Lowcountry's very foundation. It is a living tribute to the men and women and their descendants that persevered in their efforts to achieve freedom, equality, and justice. All of their stories - black and white, enslaved and free - are given their due. After years of careful research and restoration, McLeod Plantation Historic Site invites visitors to embark upon an in-depth exploration of the lives of those people whose stories are essential to understanding Charleston's complex past and helped shape who we, as a nation, are today.

Costumed tour guides share facts and stories from Buchanan's personal and professional life. Buchanan represented Pennsylvania in the United States House of Representatives and later the Senate, served as Minister to Russia, Secretary of State, and Ambassador to the United Kingdom. And, in 1856, Wheatland served as the hub of his successful campaign to become the 15th President of the United States. During his presidency, Wheatland served as Buchanan’s retreat as a divided nation struggled with slavery and states’ rights. Post-presidency, Wheatland became Buchanan’s refuge as he avoided public life after his term and retired as a private citizen. Wheatland’s tangible connection to the US Presidency, Antebellum and Civil War America, and the American political process make it instrumental to teaching history to modern day visitors.

The guidance on the Park Service helped, as it told me which bus to use. Some buses stop in the Park and some go near to the park. I couldn't tell the difference, but kept an eye on where we were and got off and had a short walk to enter the park.

I was there on a week day, so not many people around. I explored the gun emplacements.

I used tick spray - don't know if this is an issue or not.

For generations of immigrants, the Statue of Liberty was the first glimpse of America—and what an entrance it made. Of course, the statue is an immigrant itself, originally coming from France as a diplomatic gift to celebrate the centennial of the Declaration of Independence. Since then, it’s become a symbol of hope, freedom, and the city itself. It’s also starred in countless movies, from The Brutalist to Ghostbusters II, and is plastered on practically everything imaginable in NYC’s souvenir shops. Today, millions of visitors travel to Liberty Island every year to get facetime with the iconic statue. Some climb the 377 steps to reach the crown, which has incredible views of the New York skyline. Not interested in huffing up those steps? You can climb halfway to the pedestal (a relatively meager 215 steps) or cruise upward on an elevator. For an even more relaxed visit, stay on the ground and visit the Statue of Liberty Museum.

We went in twice once to do the wine tasting then I was trying to decide what bottles  to buy for friends.  The young lady that I've  never seen there before was very  Impatient she act like we were  bothering her. My friend was wondering  what one taste like and I said you can try it to see if you like it cause  we only had 4 wine tasting.  The young lady never even bother asking if she wanted to try it. Needless  to say my friend didn't  buy it either cause she didn't  know what it taste like. The second time we came in the same young lady I didn't  get her name she had glasses on and  tattoos on her hand and arms. We went up near the wine tasting  area the young girl  yelled out what are you needing.  We said we were going to buy some wine she said you can get it towards  the front area like she didn't  want us back there. Then when I said I was in the wine club she gave me one heck of a look even my friend noticed it both times we were in there. I use to love going there but the one young lady is going to run customers  away. I have to say I always bragged on the other ladies that have been there a long time. They are excellent.

At the time of my visit, this lawn was being turned into a skating rink, and some restaurants already started to decorate their outdoor seating areas for winter holidays.

The outdoor area of the Park is well marked, has many info boards, giving the schedules of current and upcoming cultural and social events. When I was walking around the area in the late afternoon, it wasn't busy: some restaurants were open, and many entertainment venues were waiting for visitors in later hours.

Set on more than 1,200 acres in the heart of the Kentucky's famous Bluegrass region, the park is THE place to get close to horses! Featuring dozens of breeds of horse at work and at play, the park showcases the horse in daily equine presentations, horse drawn tours, horseback and pony rides, and an array of horse shows and special events throughout the year. The park's International Museum of the Horse, a Smithsonian Affiliate, is the world's largest equestrian museum. Offering both the experienced horseman and novice an opportunity to explore the many facets of humanity's relationship with the horse, the museum is dedicated to all breeds and disciplines of horse and covers some 50-million years of equine history. State-of-the-art technology complements rare artifacts and scholarly research to present a unique, educational, museum experience for all ages. The American Saddlebred Museum, the Showplace for Saddlebreds, celebrates Kentucky's first native breed of horse. The museum features interactive exhibits and a movie. With the park's own tourist activities and the numerous additional horse shows that take place in the equine competition facilities throughout the year, there can be a fair amount of walking involved, depending on visitor interest level.

It was a fun experience, and I and my family thoroughly enjoyed it. People were very nice and friendly. The food at the stadium was terrible. A lot of venues pride themselves on the food they serve, but the hotdog aka Denny Dog was a hotdog and bun wrapped in aluminum foil and crushed as much as possible. Same with the Conecuh dog. The burger aka Big Al Burger was a patty and buns with nacho cheese drizzled over it wrapped in aluminum foil and squeezed as much as possible. The meat didn't look like hamburger meat at all, maybe it was soy, who knows. My whole family ended up sick with diarrhea. Shameful. A vendor behind U3 on the top deck were selling alcoholic drinks and automatically charging every single customer a 20% tip for every purchase which is credit card fraud. I will be disputing it with my bank. If a vendor doesn't let you see the tip screen when purchasing, something shady is going on. The only other thing that pissed us off was the public parking. People were sitting at virtually every entrance to various campus facilities but would only let faculty, staff, etc. park there. Some of these parking lots were totally empty. Too convenient to let the public park there. Too much greed. Ridiculous that an Orthopedic Surgeon parking lot would charge people $40 to park in their lost for 4 hours. Greed greed greed. There were others priced more.

I have never been to the winery. 

Sinskey wines are fabulous and I am a long-term fan of the POV. The customer service via online ordering is poor and finding the wine in many States is extremely difficult. Sinskey's representation in Louisiana, Texas, and Georgia has been non-responsive. I've been trying to send several cases as gifts this year and I'm working my rear end off to find where I can buy it, other than through Sinskey's online site.  Please fix the distribution issues.

By girlcat  5 of 5 bubbles Aug 2020 Serenity My husband and I visited Andretti today for the first time. We had a WONDERFUL experience. We had our 4 month old with us. First outing post her birth because of Covid. Karie was our Wine Educator, and boy did we get a lesson! Karie was extremely knowledgeable about each of the wines but so much deeper than that. We learned about Wine “DNA”, unique soil by region, and much more. Great music playing all day, Stunning views, and delicious wines all around! Jeffery was also awesome. He was serving other tables but made it a point to check in on us. The entire staff did a great job keeping the place clean and safe during the pandemic.

Loved that we could pick out our own wines for tasting.  Gorgeous setting, very relaxed, actually spent 2-1/2 hours here just kicking back and taking in the scenery.  Highly recommend! By girlcat  5 of 5 bubbles Aug 2020 Serenity My husband and I visited Andretti today for the first time. We had a WONDERFUL experience. We had our 4 month old with us. First outing post her birth because of Covid. Karie was our Wine Educator, and boy did we get a lesson! Karie was extremely knowledgeable about each of the wines but so much deeper than that. We learned about Wine “DNA”, unique soil by region, and much more. Great music playing all day, Stunning views, and delicious wines all around! Jeffery was also awesome. He was serving other tables but made it a point to check in on us. The entire staff did a great job keeping the place clean and safe during the pandemic. Needless to say, we will be back, since we signed up as members!!

Judd’s formerly private living and working spaces provide firsthand experience of Judd’s concept of permanent installation in the Chihuahuan Desert. Judd Foundation offers two different guided visits of properties in downtown Marfa, La Mansana de Chinati/The Block and The Studios. Advance reservations for guided visits are required. La Mansana de Chinati / The Block Daily, 11:00am-12:30pm and Thursday-Sunday from 4:30pm-5:45pm. Doors open 10 minutes in advance of start time. Visits to The Block begin promptly at their scheduled time. Advance reservations are required. Guided visits start at the gated entrance to La Mansana de Chinati/The Block, across from Godbold feed mill, at 400 West El Paso Street, which is at the intersection of Kelly and El Paso streets, 3 blocks west of Judd Foundation offices. La Mansana de Chinati, Judd’s residence and studio in Marfa, informally known as The Block, is the site of some of the artist’s first large-scale architectural projects. Guided visits provide access to Judd’s three main studios, which are permanently installed with his early work, and his personal library, which houses his collection of over 13,000 books. Ticket Prices $25 per person, $12.50 students and seniors, with valid ID. Guided visits are free for full-time residents of Presidio, Brewster, and Jeff Davis counties. The Studios (Architecture Studio, Art Studio and the Cobb and Whyte Houses) Friday and Saturday, 1:30-3:15pm. Thursday, Friday and Saturday, 2:00-3:45pm. Visits to The Studios visits begin promptly at their scheduled time. Advance reservations are required. Guided visits start at the Judd Foundation offices, 104 South Highland Avenue, south of the railroad tracks, across the street from the Hotel St. George. The Studios visit provides access to a selection of Juddʼs downtown spaces, including the Architecture Studio, Art Studio, and the Cobb and Whyte Houses. These spaces contain furniture by Judd, as well as his early paintings from the 1950s and 60s, along with an extensive collection of modernist and period furniture, and works by other prominent twentieth century artists and designers. Ticket Prices $25 per person, $12.50 students and seniors, with valid ID. Guided visits are free for full-time residents of Presidio, Brewster, and Jeff Davis counties.  Duration: 1-2 hours 4 of 5 bubbles Dec 2023 Cool space but tours could be better I feel like minimalist art is love it or hate it. Don’t come here if you hate it. If you love it, the “Block” tour of Judd’s residence and the “studios” tour where he worked will be right up your alley. A few huge warehouses with classic Judd pieces and offices with furniture and paintings by Judd and other artists emphasizing simple forms and clean lines.

These spaces can only be viewed via tours with no photos allowed (think of it this way - you have to come to Marfa to see this stuff). The tours move at a glacial pace. 1.5 hours for the Blocks and 1 hour for the studios. Much of the tour involves standing around in non-climate-controlled spaces. It’s minimalist art! There’s not much to look at! The guides provide no real information about the art itself, which is the most interesting part and far from self-explanatory. Instead, we spent an eternity looking at Judd’s large library. It’s a room with books. It’s not that amazing. Basically, the tours should be half as long and provide twice as much information as they do. 

The Blocks tour should be prioritized. It has the most impressive installations and Judd pieces. The studios tour is mostly just office and work space.

Improve this listing About Guided visits to Judd Foundation properties in Marfa offer visitors direct engagement with Donald Judd’s art and vision. Judd’s formerly private living and working spaces provide firsthand experience of Judd’s concept of permanent installation in the Chihuahuan Desert. Judd Foundation offers two different guided visits of properties in downtown Marfa, La Mansana de Chinati/The Block and The Studios. Advance reservations for guided visits are required. La Mansana de Chinati / The Block Daily, 11:00am-12:30pm and Thursday-Sunday from 4:30pm-5:45pm. Doors open 10 minutes in advance of start time. Visits to The Block begin promptly at their scheduled time. Advance reservations are required. Guided visits start at the gated entrance to La Mansana de Chinati/The Block, across from Godbold feed mill, at 400 West El Paso Street, which is at the intersection of Kelly and El Paso streets, 3 blocks west of Judd Foundation offices. La Mansana de Chinati, Judd’s residence and studio in Marfa, informally known as The Block, is the site of some of the artist’s first large-scale architectural projects. Guided visits provide access to Judd’s three main studios, which are permanently installed with his early work, and his personal library, which houses his collection of over 13,000 books. Ticket Prices $25 per person, $12.50 students and seniors, with valid ID. Guided visits are free for full-time residents of Presidio, Brewster, and Jeff Davis counties. The Studios (Architecture Studio, Art Studio and the Cobb and Whyte Houses) Friday and Saturday, 1:30-3:15pm. Thursday, Friday and Saturday, 2:00-3:45pm. Visits to The Studios visits begin promptly at their scheduled time. Advance reservations are required. Guided visits start at the Judd Foundation offices, 104 South Highland Avenue, south of the railroad tracks, across the street from the Hotel St. George. The Studios visit provides access to a selection of Juddʼs downtown spaces, including the Architecture Studio, Art Studio, and the Cobb and Whyte Houses. These spaces contain furniture by Judd, as well as his early paintings from the 1950s and 60s, along with an extensive collection of modernist and period furniture, and works by other prominent twentieth century artists and designers. Ticket Prices $25 per person, $12.50 students and seniors, with valid ID. Guided visits are free for full-time residents of Presidio, Brewster, and Jeff Davis counties.  Duration: 1-2 hours 4 of 5 bubbles Dec 2023 Cool space but tours could be better I feel like minimalist art is love it or hate it. Don’t come here if you hate it. If you love it, the “Block” tour of Judd’s residence and the “studios” tour where he worked will be right up your alley. A few huge warehouses with classic Judd pieces and offices with furniture and paintings by Judd and other artists emphasizing simple forms and clean lines.

These spaces can only be viewed via tours with no photos allowed (think of it this way - you have to come to Marfa to see this stuff). The tours move at a glacial pace. 1.5 hours for the Blocks and 1 hour for the studios. Much of the tour involves standing around in non-climate-controlled spaces. It’s minimalist art! There’s not much to look at! The guides provide no real information about the art itself, which is the most interesting part and far from self-explanatory. Instead, we spent an eternity looking at Judd’s large library. It’s a room with books. It’s not that amazing. Basically, the tours should be half as long and provide twice as much information as they do. 

The Blocks tour should be prioritized. It has the most impressive installations and Judd pieces. The studios tour is mostly just office and work space.

It is a very level walk along a beautiful creek, there are many fly fisherman casting along the water. We were there on a wonderful day, the weather was perfect so it made for a very relaxing time. By kirpatt2016  1 of 5 bubbles Aug 2020 R-E-S-P-E-C-T find out what it means to me The gorge is a picturesque spot and attracts many fly fishermen/women. Due to an influx in out of town visitors who have recently discovered this “hidden gem” the accessibility to the gorge has been closed and barricaded by local police for over a month. Sadly, this inaccessibility also extends to locals who reside along the gorge and access the gorge daily for recreational purposes such as fishing, biking, and running. 

This area is part of a larger expanse of preserved land in the area. The Ken Lockwood Gorge and neighboring Lake Solitude are not state parks. As such, there are no garbage receptacles here and no public restrooms. Please practice common courtesy and respect before you relieve yourself on the trail or in the yards of locals, block driveway access, and litter in yards. Picking fruit and flowers from personal gardens or wandering onto the property of others is also strongly discouraged. 

The waters of the gorge and Lake Solitude are not for swimming. Although it may be tempting on a hot day, the waters are primarily used for trout fishing. There are signs posted that denote this everywhere.

I highly recommend a visit to the gorge for individuals and families who enjoy biking, walking, and respecting nature. For those who intend to come to take a dip in the water, drink alcohol (and subsequently smash glass bottles on paths that bicyclists and dogs access), and litter I would highly recommend traveling elsewhere or perhaps, just stay at home.

Please practice common courtesy and respect before you relieve yourself on the trail or in the yards of locals, block driveway access, and litter in yards. Picking fruit and flowers from personal gardens or wandering onto the property of others is also strongly discouraged. 

The waters of the gorge and Lake Solitude are not for swimming. Although it may be tempting on a hot day, the waters are primarily used for trout fishing. There are signs posted that denote this everywhere.

I highly recommend a visit to the gorge for individuals and families who enjoy biking, walking, and respecting nature. For those who intend to come to take a dip in the water, drink alcohol (and subsequently smash glass bottles on paths that bicyclists and dogs access), and litter I would highly recommend traveling elsewhere or perhaps, just stay at home.
